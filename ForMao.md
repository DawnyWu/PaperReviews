* Segment-based method
* Path-based method


**Road segment**: 

Road segment is a directed edge with two terminal points

**Trajectory**: 

A spatial trajectory *Tr* is a sequence of time-ordered points, 􏰦􏰠: 􏰱􏰡 􏰢 􏰱􏰣 􏰢 􏰲 􏰢 􏰱􏰳 , where each point has a geospatial coordinate set and a timestamp, 􏰱 􏰴 􏰵􏰶, 􏰷, 􏰸􏰹.


### A Simple Baseline for Travel Time Estimation using Large-Scale Trip Data

To the best of our knowledge, we are **the first** to directly work on such origin-destination (OD) travel time queries

We call our method as *neighbor-based method*. The biggest benefit of our approach is its simplicity.
