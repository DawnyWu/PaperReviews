* Segment-based method
* Path-based method

**Road Network**
> A road network *RN* is comprised of a set of road segments *{ r }* connected among each other in a graph format.

**Road segment**: 

> Road segment *r* is a directed edge with two terminal points

**Trajectory**: 

> A spatial trajectory *Tr* is a sequence of time-ordered points, *Tr: p<sub>1</sub> -> p<sub>2</sub> -> ... -> p<sub>n</sub>* , where each point has a geospatial coordinate set and a timestamp, *p = (x, y, t)*.

**Path**: 
> A path *P* is represented by a sequence of connected road segments, e.g., *P: r<sub>1</sub> -> r<sub>2</sub> -> ... -> r<sub>n</sub>*, in an *RN*.


















### A Simple Baseline for Travel Time Estimation using Large-Scale Trip Data

To the best of our knowledge, we are **the first** to directly work on such origin-destination (OD) travel time queries

We call our method as *neighbor-based method*. The biggest benefit of our approach is its simplicity.
