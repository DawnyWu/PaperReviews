### A Simple Baseline for Travel Time Estimation using Large-Scale Trip Data

To the best of our knowledge, we are **the first** to directly work on such origin-destination (OD) travel time queries

We call our method as *neighbor-based method*. The biggest benefit of our approach is its simplicity.
